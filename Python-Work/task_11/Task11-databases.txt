Why do you need databases and don't save everything into .json files?

- DB needed to save a large amount of data 
- DB are scalable in order to secure high performance 
- .json file aren't always the best way to save your data (structure)
- file could get lost/corrupted (let's imagine you don't create a backup)
- DB gives the opportunity to split your data across multiples DBs


relational database (RDBMS)
- small amount of data
- if you want to enforce constraints
- factual & numeric data
- if you are looking for flexible queries
- hard to setup but easier to manage later
- small projects with lower scaling
- access pattern not known yet


NoSQL (non relational SQL)
- large amount of 'messy' data
    - structure of data is not relevant (schemaless)
- known access patterns (includes PK)
- okay with high performance but less flexible queries
- offers better scaling in case you get more large amount of data (partitions, hashs)
- if you are dealing with real time data
- large projects with high scale + performance


What is SQL
- Structured query language
- language in order to deal with relational databases
    - for storing, manipulating and retreiving data from databases
- database management systems:
    - mysql
    - postgreSQL (pgAdmin4)
    - MS Access (microsoft access)
    - Oracle


TIPICAL COMMANDS:
SELECT  - used to specify a column where you want your data from
FROM    - used to specify a table where you want your data from
WHERE   - used to set conditions which data you want to retreive
INSERT  - used to add data to a table


PostgreSQL  - object-relational database
            - a place to manage databases
            - a place to create databases (?)
    - pgAdmin4 software/tool to handle the database
