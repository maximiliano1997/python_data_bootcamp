If you run line 29 you will get the image source code as: //:0

The reason why is the following:
Starting with // (omitting the protocol) causes the protocol of the current page to be used,
preventing "insecure content" warnings in HTTPS pages. Skipping the host name isn't necessary,
but makes it shorter. Finally, a port of :0 ensures that a server request can't be made (it isn't a valid port,
according to the spec).

What does this mean?
You can't get the image source code because the server won't allow it.
