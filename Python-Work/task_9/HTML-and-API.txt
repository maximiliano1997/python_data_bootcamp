API (Application Programming Interface)
- Messenger between 2 applications
    - Appl.1 wants certain data and gives it to API
    - API sends data to server (Appl.2) -> server from Appl.2 looks up requested data
    - after getting the requested data Appl.2 sends it back to API
    - API takes data and sends it to Appl.1 in away that Appl.1 can read it


Example:
- Customer (Appl.1), Waiter (API), Restaurant(Appl.2)
    > Customer wants to eat a Burger
    > C gives this information to Waiter
    > Waiter sends this information to Restaurant
    > R knows this information and makes the Burger
    > Burger which was asked for will be send to W
    > W will send Burger to C
    > C has the requested Burger
